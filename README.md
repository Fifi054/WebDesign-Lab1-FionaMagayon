1. A website is a collection of web pages that people can visit to get information, like blogs or school pages. A web application, on the other hand, is something you can actually interact with, like logging in, creating an account, or doing tasks online. Websites mostly show information, while web apps let you do things.

2. Organizations need websites so people can easily find information about them online. For schools, it helps students and parents stay updated on announcements and events. For offices or companies, it’s a way to promote their services and reach more people. Basically, a website helps them connect with others and build their online presence.

3. At first, I found it a bit confusing to use Git and GitHub. I wasn’t sure how to properly upload files, make commits, or connect my local work to the online repository. But after exploring and trying things out, I started to understand how it works and realized how useful it is for keeping track of changes and organizing projects.

4. Writing a README is really helpful because it makes it easier to explain what your project is all about. It’s like leaving notes for yourself and others who might look at your work later. It also keeps everything organized and makes the project look more complete and professional.
